# 
# This file explains the contents of this directory which contains
# supplementary data for the paper "Influenza sequence validation and
# annotation using VADR", specifically output files from FLAN 
# run on the training and testing sets described in the paper.
#
# =====================================================================
#
# There are 19 files in this directory, one is this README file. 
# The other 18 are flan output tables for the 18 training and testing
# sets obtained by inputting each of those sets to the FLAN webserver 
# (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/annotation/). The
# .flan.tbl files in this directory are the files downloaded from the
# FLAN webserver by selecting "Download"->"Feature table" (not
# "Feature table (clean)". 
# 
# These files are used by the scripts in the 'tables2-5-6-files'
# directory to create tables 2, 5 and 6 in the paper.
#
# The 6 files that begin with 'train.' were obtained by running FLAN
# in May 2023. The 12 files that begin with 'test' were obtained by
# running FLAN in December 2023.
